### LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey
##### Greff, et al. (2015)
Which of these variants is best? Do the differences matter? Greff, et al. (2015) do a nice comparison of popular variants, finding that theyâ€™re all about the same.

### An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures
##### Jozefowicz, et al. (2015)
Jozefowicz, et al. (2015) tested more than ten thousand RNN architectures, finding some that worked better than LSTMs on certain tasks.
