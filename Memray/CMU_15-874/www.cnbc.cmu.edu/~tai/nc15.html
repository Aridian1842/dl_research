<h1>15-386/686 Neural Computation </h1>

<h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
<h2>Spring 2015 </h2>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

Neural Computation is an area of interdisciplinary study that seeks to
understand how the brain computes to achieve natural intelligence.  It seeks
to understand the computational principles and mechanisms of intelligent
behaviors and mental abilities -- such as perception, language, motor control,
and learning -- by building artificial systems and computational models with
the same capabilities.  This course explores how neurons encode and process
information, adapt and learn, communicate and compute at the individual level
as well as at the levels of networks and systems. It will cover basic concepts
in computational and neuronal modeling, neural encoding and decoding strategies, neural
networks and learning, signal processing and system analysis, statistical 
learning and probabilistic inference.  Concrete examples will be drawn from the
visual system and the motor system, including deep learning and brain computer interface. 
Students will learn to perform quantitative analysis and
perform computational experiments using Matlab.  No prior background in biology
is assumed.

Prerequisites: 15-100, 21-120 or permission of instructor. 21-241 preferred but
not required.

</tbody>
</table>

<li> Grading scheme: A: > 88 B: > 75. C: > 65. 

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<ul>
<li>  6 Matlab programming or mathematical assignments. 
The solution should be in pdf file,
and should be submitted before class to blackboard. 
</li> 

<li>
Collaboration in team of two is allowed for the first two assignments.
</li> 

</ul>

<h3>Term Project </h3>

<ul>

<li>Term project is optional for 386 students. 
A 386 student can use the OPTIONAL term project 
to replace one quiz or assignment grade, and/or to 
contribute to up to 50% of their final exam grade. 
Collaboration is allowed, but in this case, it can't be used
to replace homework or quiz grades, but can contribute to the final, 
i.e. the final exam will only count for 15 points for these students. 
It will require a 6 pages written final report and a presentation to the class.
Matlab codes and additional output should also be submitted as supplementary
materials in a different pdf/doc file and/or matlab zip files.</li>

<li>Term project is required of 686 students.
Collaboration is allowed, but the project will need to be approved by the instructor. 
The project grade will only receive letter grade (A,B,C). 
A 686 student will receive an A if his project a A or B AND his "386" score 
equals or greater than 88%. 
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The quizzes and final exam will 
cover materials covered in lectures. 
Students are encouraged to study together for these exams. 
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<ul>
<li>You will have about 2 weeks to do each homework assignment.
Homework report should be type-written. You should submit a hardcopy,
documenting all the answers and results in class on the due day,
as well as a softcopy of write-up and the codes to Blackboard before
noon on the due day. Blackboard submission after noon is considered late. </li>

<li> All students are allowed to collaborate in the FIRST two assignments ONLY 
to facilitate matlab learning.
Each should submit a copy of the solution, but should list his/her partner, if any,
on the first page of the report. </li>

<li>Each student has six days grace for submitting their assignments late without penalty. 
This six-day grace can be used all together for one assignment, submitting one assignment 6 days late, or used separately for different assignments, submitting each assignment one day late.
Blackboard submission after noon on the due day is considered late. </li>

<li>No extension possible for the term project. </li>

<h3>Final Grade Assignment </h3>
<ul>
  <li>386 students: A for total grade >= 88 %, B: < 88 AND >= 75, C: < 75, >=60.  F for cheating.
</li>
  <li>686 students: A for total grade >= 88 % (same as 386) and getting an A or B for their term projects. 
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
