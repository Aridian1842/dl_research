<h1>86-375/675 Computational Perception </h1>

<h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
<h2>Spring 2012 </h2>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

The perceptual capabilities of even the simplest biological organisms are far beyond what we can achieve with machines. Whether you look at sensitivity, robustness, or sheer perceptual power, perception in biology just works, and works in complex, ever changing environments, and can pick up the most subtle sensory patterns. Is it the neural hardware? Does biology solve fundamentally different problems? What can we learn from biological systems and human perception? 

In this course, we will first study the biological and psychological data of biological perceptual systems in depth, and then apply computational thinking to investigate the principles and mechanisms underlying natural perception. The course will focus on visual perception this year.  You will learn how to reason scientifically and computationally about problems and issues in perception, how to extract the essential computational properties of those abstract ideas, and finally how to convert these into explicit mathematical models and computational algorithms. The course is targeted to neuroscience and psychology students who are interested in learning computational thinking, and computer science and engineering students who are interested in learning more about the neural basis of perception. Prerequisites: First year college calculus, some linear algebra, probability theory and programming experience are desirable.

<li> Grading scheme: A: > 85, B: > 75. C: > 65. 

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<ul>
<li> (A) 12 weekly assignments (5 points each), each with three parts:  (1) 
Each student is responsible reading the textbook or doing research to 
answer questions posed by the professor. 
(2) Each student is also responsible for coming with
a question that interests him/her the most on the topic, and for
providing his/her answer for that question.
(3) Participation in class discussion of these questions. 
</li> 

<li>
(B) The assignment answer should be in pdf file, and cannot exceed one page per part,
and should be submitted before class to blackboard. 
</li> 

<li>
(C) Collaboration in team of two is allowed on (A1). Each person should
work on (A2) alone. But each pair can only
work together at most three times during the semester. 
</li> 

<li>
(D) Only the top 10 scores will be counted, with a max total of 50.
</li> 

<li>
(E) Excess homework grades (over 50) can count toward the final exam. 
</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Term Project </h3>

<ul>

<li>Term project is optional for 375 students. 
A student can use the OPTIONAL term project (with a max score of 17 points) 
to replace the combined grade of 20 points worth of 
assignment/quiz grades, or contribute to the final exam grade. No collaboration is allowed. 
It will require a 6 pages written final report and a presentation to the class.
Matlab codes and additional output should also be submitted as supplementary
materials in a different pdf/doc file and/or matlab zip files.</li>

<li>Term project is required of 675 students, and will be graded in percentile
according to written report and presentation.
Respectable performance in term project (e.g. achieving a top 65 percentile among all class projects) 
in addition to achieving 85 percent
in the other scores, is required for an A.
Students are encouraged to work on issues that are not covered in the course, for example,
adaptation and visual learning, art and perception, neural basis, etc.  
</ul>


</ul>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There will be two quizzes to test understanding of the materials covered
in the book and issues discussed in the lectures. 
The closed-book Final Exam will ask pre-distributed questions.
Students are encouraged to study together for these exams. 
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<ul>

<li>No late homework will be accepted. 
Blackboard submission after the starting of class time is considered late. </li>
<li>No extension possible for the term paper.
</li>

</ul>
