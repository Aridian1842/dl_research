<h1>16-385 Computer Vision </h1>

<h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
<h2>Spring 2013 School of Computer Science</h2>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

An introduction to the theory and practice of computer vision, i.e. the analysis of the patterns in visual images with the view to understanding the objects and processes in the world that generate them. Major topics include optics, image representation, feature extraction, image processing, object recognition, feature selection, probabilistic inference, perceptual analysis and organization, dynamic and hierarchical processing. The emphasis is on the learning of mathematical concepts and techniques and the translation of them to Matlab programs to solve real vision problem. The discussion will be guided by comparision with human and animal vision, from psychological and biological perspectives. 

Prerequisites: 15-100, 21-120 or permission of instructor. 21-241 preferred but
not required.

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Homework report should be type-written. You should submit a hardcopy,
documenting all the answers and results, in class on the due day. You should also
submit a softcopy of write-up and the codes to Blackboard before 10:00 a.m. 
on the due day. Blackboard submission after 10:00 a.m. is considered late. </li>

<li> You are allowed to collaborate in certain specified parts of the first two assignments 
and in the term project. Each should submit a copy of the solution, but should 
list his/her partner, if any, on the first page of the report.  
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<ul>

<li>Each student has ONE chance to turn in one of five the homework assignments late 
within one week without penalty. 
</li>
<li>If you need to submit a late homework after using the one free late, you will receive a 5 percent 
deduction of your earned homework credit every two days, until the solution set is released. </li>
<li>No extension possible for the term project.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Term project</h3>
<ul>


<li>The term project of your own design. There are however more structured competiton challenges
we could suggest. You should talk to the instructor and TA to come up with a project earlier in March.
You will need to submit a proposal (worth 5 points), with motivation  
and background and preliminary data, to get approval. 
</li>

<li>
The projects will be presented in oral presentation session and/or a poster session.
Your fellow students will participate in voting for best projects. 
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There will be two quizzes to test understanding of the materials covered and discussed in the lectures. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Grade Assignment </h3>

<ul>
  <li>A for total grade >= 88 %, B: < 88 AND >= 75, C: < 75, >=60.  F for cheating.  
</li>
</ul>
