<h1>15-385/685 Computer Vision </h1>

<h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
<h2>Spring 2011 School of Computer Science</h2>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

An introduction to the theory and practice of computer vision, i.e. the analysis of the patterns in visual images with the view to understanding the objects and processes in the world that generate them. Major topics include optics, image representation, feature extraction, image processing, object recognition, feature selection, probabilistic inference, perceptual analysis and organization, dynamic and hierarchical processing. The emphasis is on the learning of mathematical concepts and techniques and the translation of them to Matlab programs to solve real vision problem. The discussion will be guided by comparision with human and animal vision, from psychological and biological perspectives. 

Prerequisites: 15-100, 21-120 or permission of instructor. 21-241 preferred but
not required.

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<ul>

<li>You will have about 2 weeks to do each homework assignment.
Homework report should be type-written. You should submit a hardcopy,
documenting all the answers and results in class on the due day,
as well as a softcopy of write-up and the codes to Blackboard before 10:00 a.m. 
on the due day. Blackboard submission after 10:00 a.m. is considered late. </li>

<li> 385 students are allowed to collaborate in the two first assignments
and in the term project, but not in the third and fourth assignments.  
Each should submit a copy of the solution, but should list his/her partner, if any,
on the first page of the report. 
</li>

<li>685 students need to complete all the work
required of 385, and compete at the same scale. 
They have to complete the additional
challenge questions in each homework (no collaboration). The total grade for these additional
questions for all the assignments have to be over 80 percent to be considered satisfactory. </li> 
No collaboration is allowed for 685 students in any work.  
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<ul>

<li>Each student has ONE chance to turn in one of four the homework assignments late 
within one week without penalty. However, 
Blackboard submission after noon on the due day is considered late. </li>
<li>If you need to submit a late homework after using the one free late, you will receive 5 percent 
deduction of your maximum credit per lecture until the solution set is released. </li>
<li>No extension possible for the term project.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Term project</h3>
<ul>

<li>385 students have to do a term project. They might work in pair.
</li>
<li>
685 students
have to do a term project individually, no partner allowed. 
In addition, their projects
need an extensive background review.
</li>

<li>The term project will consist of a (1 page) proposal, a (1 page) progress report, and
a (up to 6 page) final report, in the CVPR format provided. 
Matlab codes and additional output should also be submitted as supplementary
materials in a different pdf/doc file and/or matlab files.</li>

<li>
The projects will be presented on the day of the
Final Exam. Format to be defined. 
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There will be two quizzes to test understanding of the materials covered and discussed in the lectures. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Requirement for 685 students </h3>
<ul>
  <li> 
(1) 685 students have to complete the additional
challenge questions in each homework (no collaboration). The total grade for these additional
questions for all the assignments have to be over 80 percent to be considered satisfactory. 
In the event of unsatisfactory performance, 685 students will be given a second chance to make up
one challenge homework by doing 
an instructor specified challenge during the term project period. </li> 
<li>
(2) Their project is expected to be more substantial, and the
term paper/report is expected to be accompanied by a in-depth literature
review like a conference paper.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Grade Assignment </h3>

<ul>
  <li>385 students: A for total grade >= 88 %, B: < 88 AND >= 75, C: < 75, >=60.  F for cheating.  
</li>
  <li>685 students: A for total grade >= 88 % AND satisfactory performance of the additional assignments. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Laboratory/Help Sessions </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Matlab tutorial sessions: 
</li>
<li>
Hunt Lower Level Near/Far 5:30 PM-7:00 PM 01/20/2011
</li>
<li>
Hunt Lower Level Near/Far 5:30 PM-7:00 PM 01/26/2011 
</li>

  <li>Lab/Help sessions:
The teaching assistants will hold "Lab/Help" sessions every other week, at the same place, and at the same time,
to help students with programming issues as well as homework assignments.
</li>
</ul>
